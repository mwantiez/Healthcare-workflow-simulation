# healthcare-workflow-simulation
This project simulates a basic outpatient clinical workflow, showing how a patient moves through check-in, triage, provider visit, and follow-up. It also highlights how EHR systems, HL7 messaging, and medical coding standards (ICD-10, CPT, LOINC, SNOMED) support each step.

Objective
To showcase Informatics knowledge through workflow diagrams, system roles, and simplified data simulation using Python.

 Contents
- Workflow diagrams (swimlane, data flow)
- Python simulation script
- Reference notes on HL7 message types and coding systems

Tools Used
- Python
- Diagrams.net / Lucidchart (for visuals)
- Markdown for documentation

 Topics Covered
- Outpatient visit structure
- EHR + LIS + PMS integration points
- HL7 vs FHIR message examples
- CPT, ICD-10, SNOMED coding
